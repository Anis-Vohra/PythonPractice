# Problem: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
# Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/
# Date: 7/5/2025
# Level: Easy
# Tags: Array, Two Pointers
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(1)
# Approach: Use two pointers to shift unique values to the front of the list.

def remove_dups(nums):
    # If the input list is empty, there is no elements to process
    if not nums:
        return 0
   
    # The slow pointer keeps track of the index where the next unique number should go
    slow = 1
  
    # Start the loop from the second element (index 1)
    for fast in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Compare current number to the one just before it
        # If they are different, it means we found a new unique number
        if nums[fast] != nums[fast - 1]:
            # Copy the new unique number to the slow pointer position
            nums[slow] = nums[fast]
            # Move the slow pointer to the next available spot for a future unique number
            slow += 1
   
    # After the loop finishes, slow is the count of unique elements
    # The first slow elements in numbs are now the deduplicated values
    return slow
