# Python Practice – LeetCode Problem Solving

Welcome to my `python-practice` repository! This is a collection of Python solutions to a curated set of LeetCode problems that I’m solving over the course of 30 days (and beyond). The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills, master data structures and algorithms, and prepare for technical interviews.

---

## Overall Goals
- Strengthen core CS fundamentals
- Build consistency in problem solving
- Prepare for technical interviews (remote SWE/QA roles)

---

## Goal 1: 30 Days of LeetCode (Easy Level)
Covers foundational patterns and techniques:
- Arrays & Strings  
- Hash Maps & Sets  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Recursion  
- Binary Search  
- Math & Bit Manipulation  
- Stacks & Queues  

---

## Goal 2: 30 Days of LeetCode (Medium Level)
Introduces multi-step reasoning and common patterns:
- Sliding Window  
- DFS/BFS  
- Prefix Sum  
- Hash Maps (advanced usage)  
- Backtracking  

---

## Goal 3: 30 Days of LeetCode (Hard Level)
Focuses on complex data structures and algorithmic optimization:
- Dynamic Programming  
- Graphs & Topological Sort  
- Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)  
- Tries (Prefix Trees)  
- Segment Trees  
- Bitmasking
