# Python Practice – LeetCode Problem Solving

Welcome to my `python-practice` repository! This is a collection of Python solutions to a curated set of LeetCode problems that I’m solving over the course of 30 days (and beyond). The goal is to strengthen my problem-solving skills, master data structures and algorithms, and prepare for technical interviews.

## Overall Goals
- Strengthen core CS fundamentals
- Build consistency in problem solving
- Prepare for technical interviews (remote SWE/QA roles)

## Goal 1: 30 Days of LeetCode (Easy Level)
Covers foundational patterns and techniques:
- Arrays & Strings  
- Hash Maps & Sets  
- Linked Lists  
- Trees & Recursion  
- Binary Search  
- Math & Bit Manipulation  
- Stacks & Queues
